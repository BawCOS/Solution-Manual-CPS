A migraine is a particularly painful type of headache, which patients sometimes wish to treat with acupuncture. To determine whether acupuncture relieves migraine pain, researchers conducted a randomized controlled study where 89 females diagnosed with migraine headaches were randomly assigned to one of two groups: treatment or control. 43 patients in the treatment group received acupuncture that is specifically designed to treat migraines. 46 patients in the control group received placebo acupuncture (needle insertion at nonacupoint locations). 24 hours after patients received acupuncture, they were asked if they were pain free.1 The data is in the file migraine_study.csv in the folder data. Complete the following work: Read the data an object called migraine_study. migraine_study &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/migraine_study.csv&quot;) head(migraine_study) ## # A tibble: 6 x 2 ## group pain_free ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 treatment yes ## 2 treatment yes ## 3 treatment yes ## 4 treatment yes ## 5 treatment yes ## 6 treatment yes Create a table of the data. tally(pain_free~group,data=migraine_study,format=&quot;proportion&quot;,margin=TRUE) ## group ## pain_free control treatment ## no 0.95652174 0.76744186 ## yes 0.04347826 0.23255814 ## Total 1.00000000 1.00000000 Report the percent of patients in the treatment group who were pain free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture. There are 23.2% of the treatment group pain free. Repeat for the control group. There are only 4.3% of the control group pain free. At first glance, does acupuncture appear to be an effective treatment for migraines? Explain your reasoning. Yes, a substantial increase in the percentage of patients pain free after acupuncture versus those with no acupuncture, so it appears to be effective. Do the data provide convincing evidence that there is a real pain reduction for those patients in the treatment group? Or do you think that the observed difference might just be due to chance? Either of these is acceptable: i. We could get slightly different group estimates even if there is no real difference. Though the difference is big, Im skeptical the results show a real difference and think this might be due to chance. ii. The difference in these rates looks pretty big, and so I suspect acupuncture is having a positive impact on pain. Compile, knit, this report into a pdf. Complete on your computer or server. G.

During the study air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring stations. Specifically, levels of carbon monoxide were recorded in parts per million, nitrogen dioxide and ozone in parts per hundred million, and coarse particulate matter (PM\\(_{10}\\)) in \\(\\mu g/m^3\\). Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993, and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each birth. The analysis suggested that increased ambient PM\\(_{10}\\) and, to a lesser degree, CO concentrations may be associated with the occurrence of preterm births.2 The cases are 143,196 eligible study subjects who were born in Southern California between 1989 and 1993. The variables are measurements of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter less than 10\\(\\mu m\\) (PM10) collected at air-quality-monitoring stations as well as length of gestation. All of these variables are continuous numerical variables. The research question was Is there an association between air pollution exposure and preterm births? 2.2.2 Problem 2 The Buteyko method is a shallow breathing technique developed by Konstantin Buteyko, a Russian doctor, in 1952. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Buteyko method can reduce asthma symptoms and improve quality of life. In a scientific study to determine the effectiveness of this method, researchers recruited 600 asthma patients aged 18-69 who relied on medication for asthma treatment. These patients were split into two research groups: one practiced the Buteyko method and the other did not. Patients were scored on quality of life, activity, asthma symptoms, and medication reduction on a scale from 0 to 10. On average, the participants in the Buteyko group experienced a significant reduction in asthma symptoms and an improvement in quality of life.3 The cases are 600 adult patients aged 18-69 years diagnosed and currently treated for asthma. The variables were whether or not the patient practiced the Buteyko method (categorical) and measures of quality of life, activity, asthma symptoms and medication reduction of the patients (categorical, ordinal). It may also be reasonable to treat the ratings on a scale of 1 to 10 as discrete numerical variables. The research question was Do asthmatic patients who practice the Buteyko method experience improvement in their condition? B. Ritz et al.

From a description of a research project, at a minimum be able to describe the population of interest, the generalizability of the study, the response and predictor variables, differentiate whether it is observational or experimental, and determine the type of sample. 3.2 Homework 3.2.1 Problem 1 Generalizability and causality. Identify the population of interest and the sample in the studies described below, these are the same studies from the prevous lesson. Also comment on whether or not the results of the study can be generalized to the population and if the findings of the study can be used to establish causal relationships. Researchers collected data to examine the relationship between pollutants and preterm births in Southern California. During the study air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring stations. Specifically, levels of carbon monoxide were recorded in parts per million, nitrogen dioxide and ozone in parts per hundred million, and coarse particulate matter (PM\\(_{10}\\)) in \\(\\mu g/m^3\\).

The analysis suggested that increased ambient PM\\(_{10}\\) and, to a lesser degree, CO concentrations may be associated with the occurrence of preterm births.4 The population of interest is all births. The sample consists of the 143,196 births between 1989 and 1993 in Southern California. If births in this time span at the geography can be considered to be representative of all births, then the results are generalizable to the population of Southern California. However, since the study is observational the findings cannot be used to establish causal relationships. The Buteyko method is a shallow breathing technique developed by Konstantin Buteyko, a Russian doctor, in 1952. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Buteyko method can reduce asthma symptoms and improve quality of life. In a scientific study to determine the effectiveness of this method, researchers recruited 600 asthma patients aged 18-69 who relied on medication for asthma treatment.

Patients were scored on quality of life, activity, asthma symptoms, and medication reduction on a scale from 0 to 10. On average, the participants in the Buteyko group experienced a significant reduction in asthma symptoms and an improvement in quality of life.5 The population is all 18-69 year olds diagnosed and currently treated for asthma. The sample is the 600 adult patients aged 18-69 years diagnosed and currently treated for asthma. Since the sample is not random (voluntary) the results cannot be generalized to the population at large. However, since the study is an experiment, the findings can be used to establish causal relationships. 3.2.2 Problem 2 GPA and study time. A survey was conducted on 55 undergraduates from Duke University who took an introductory statistics course in Spring 2012. Among many other questions, this survey asked them about their GPA and the number of hours they spent studying per week. The scatterplot below displays the relationship between these two variables. What is the explanatory variable and what is the response variable? Describe the relationship between the two variables. Make sure to discuss unusual observations, if any. Is this an experiment or an observational study? Can we conclude that studying longer hours leads to higher GPAs? Solutions The explanatory variable is the number of study hours per week, and the response variable is GPA. There is a somewhat weak positive relationship between the two variables, though the data become more sparse as the number of study hours increases. One responded reported a GPA above 4.0, which is clearly a data error. Also, there are a few respondents who reported unusually high study hours (60 and 70 hours/week). It should also be noted that the variability in GPA is much higher for students who study less than those who study more, also might be due to the fact that there arent many respondents who reported studying higher hours. This is an observational study. Since this is an observational study, we cannot conclude that there is a causal relationship between the two variables even though there appears to be an association. 3.2.3 Problem 3 Income and education The scatterplot below shows the relationship between per capita income (in thousands of dollars) and percent of population with a bachelors degree in 3,143 counties in the US in 2010. What are the explanatory and response variables? Describe the relationship between the two variables. Make sure to discuss unusual observations, if any. Can we conclude that having a bachelors degree increases ones income? Solutions The explanatory variable is percent of population with a bachelors degree and the response variable is per capita income (in thousands). There is a strong positive linear relationship between the two variables. As the percentage of population with a bachelors degree increases the per capita income increases as well. There are very few counties where more than 60% of the population have a bachelors degree and very few countries that have a more than $50,000 in per capita income. This is an observational study so we cannot make a causal statement based on the results. However, we can say that having a higher percentage of population with bachelors degree is associated with a higher per capita income. B. Ritz et al.
