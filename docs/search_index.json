A migraine is a particularly painful type of headache, which patients sometimes wish to treat with acupuncture. To determine whether acupuncture relieves migraine pain, researchers conducted a randomized controlled study where 89 females diagnosed with migraine headaches were randomly assigned to one of two groups: treatment or control. 43 patients in the treatment group received acupuncture that is specifically designed to treat migraines. 46 patients in the control group received placebo acupuncture (needle insertion at nonacupoint locations). 24 hours after patients received acupuncture, they were asked if they were pain free.1 The data is in the file migraine_study.csv in the folder data. Complete the following work: Read the data an object called migraine_study. migraine_study &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/migraine_study.csv&quot;) head(migraine_study) ## # A tibble: 6 x 2 ## group pain_free ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 treatment yes ## 2 treatment yes ## 3 treatment yes ## 4 treatment yes ## 5 treatment yes ## 6 treatment yes Create a table of the data. tally(pain_free~group,data=migraine_study,format=&quot;proportion&quot;,margin=TRUE) ## group ## pain_free control treatment ## no 0.95652174 0.76744186 ## yes 0.04347826 0.23255814 ## Total 1.00000000 1.00000000 Report the percent of patients in the treatment group who were pain free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture. There are 23.2% of the treatment group pain free. Repeat for the control group. There are only 4.3% of the control group pain free. At first glance, does acupuncture appear to be an effective treatment for migraines? Explain your reasoning. Yes, a substantial increase in the percentage of patients pain free after acupuncture versus those with no acupuncture, so it appears to be effective. Do the data provide convincing evidence that there is a real pain reduction for those patients in the treatment group? Or do you think that the observed difference might just be due to chance? Either of these is acceptable: i. We could get slightly different group estimates even if there is no real difference. Though the difference is big, Im skeptical the results show a real difference and think this might be due to chance. ii. The difference in these rates looks pretty big, and so I suspect acupuncture is having a positive impact on pain. Compile, knit, this report into a pdf. Complete on your computer or server. G.

During the study air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring stations. Specifically, levels of carbon monoxide were recorded in parts per million, nitrogen dioxide and ozone in parts per hundred million, and coarse particulate matter (PM\\(_{10}\\)) in \\(\\mu g/m^3\\). Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993, and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each birth. The analysis suggested that increased ambient PM\\(_{10}\\) and, to a lesser degree, CO concentrations may be associated with the occurrence of preterm births.2 The cases are 143,196 eligible study subjects who were born in Southern California between 1989 and 1993. The variables are measurements of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter less than 10\\(\\mu m\\) (PM10) collected at air-quality-monitoring stations as well as length of gestation. All of these variables are continuous numerical variables. The research question was Is there an association between air pollution exposure and preterm births? 2.2.2 Problem 2 The Buteyko method is a shallow breathing technique developed by Konstantin Buteyko, a Russian doctor, in 1952. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Buteyko method can reduce asthma symptoms and improve quality of life. In a scientific study to determine the effectiveness of this method, researchers recruited 600 asthma patients aged 18-69 who relied on medication for asthma treatment. These patients were split into two research groups: one practiced the Buteyko method and the other did not. Patients were scored on quality of life, activity, asthma symptoms, and medication reduction on a scale from 0 to 10. On average, the participants in the Buteyko group experienced a significant reduction in asthma symptoms and an improvement in quality of life.3 The cases are 600 adult patients aged 18-69 years diagnosed and currently treated for asthma. The variables were whether or not the patient practiced the Buteyko method (categorical) and measures of quality of life, activity, asthma symptoms and medication reduction of the patients (categorical, ordinal). It may also be reasonable to treat the ratings on a scale of 1 to 10 as discrete numerical variables. The research question was Do asthmatic patients who practice the Buteyko method experience improvement in their condition? B. Ritz et al.

From a description of a research project, at a minimum be able to describe the population of interest, the generalizability of the study, the response and predictor variables, differentiate whether it is observational or experimental, and determine the type of sample. 3.2 Homework 3.2.1 Problem 1 Generalizability and causality. Identify the population of interest and the sample in the studies described below, these are the same studies from the prevous lesson. Also comment on whether or not the results of the study can be generalized to the population and if the findings of the study can be used to establish causal relationships. Researchers collected data to examine the relationship between pollutants and preterm births in Southern California. During the study air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring stations. Specifically, levels of carbon monoxide were recorded in parts per million, nitrogen dioxide and ozone in parts per hundred million, and coarse particulate matter (PM\\(_{10}\\)) in \\(\\mu g/m^3\\).

The analysis suggested that increased ambient PM\\(_{10}\\) and, to a lesser degree, CO concentrations may be associated with the occurrence of preterm births.4 The population of interest is all births. The sample consists of the 143,196 births between 1989 and 1993 in Southern California. If births in this time span at the geography can be considered to be representative of all births, then the results are generalizable to the population of Southern California. However, since the study is observational the findings cannot be used to establish causal relationships.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Buteyko method can reduce asthma symptoms and improve quality of life.

On average, the participants in the Buteyko group experienced a significant reduction in asthma symptoms and an improvement in quality of life.5 The population is all 18-69 year olds diagnosed and currently treated for asthma. The sample is the 600 adult patients aged 18-69 years diagnosed and currently treated for asthma. Since the sample is not random (voluntary) the results cannot be generalized to the population at large. However, since the study is an experiment, the findings can be used to establish causal relationships. 3.2.2 Problem 2 GPA and study time. A survey was conducted on 55 undergraduates from Duke University who took an introductory statistics course in Spring 2012. Among many other questions, this survey asked them about their GPA and the number of hours they spent studying per week. The scatterplot below displays the relationship between these two variables. What is the explanatory variable and what is the response variable? Describe the relationship between the two variables. Make sure to discuss unusual observations, if any. Is this an experiment or an observational study? Can we conclude that studying longer hours leads to higher GPAs? Solutions The explanatory variable is the number of study hours per week, and the response variable is GPA. There is a somewhat weak positive relationship between the two variables, though the data become more sparse as the number of study hours increases. One responded reported a GPA above 4.0, which is clearly a data error. Also, there are a few respondents who reported unusually high study hours (60 and 70 hours/week). It should also be noted that the variability in GPA is much higher for students who study less than those who study more, also might be due to the fact that there arent many respondents who reported studying higher hours. This is an observational study. Since this is an observational study, we cannot conclude that there is a causal relationship between the two variables even though there appears to be an association. 3.2.3 Problem 3 Income and education The scatterplot below shows the relationship between per capita income (in thousands of dollars) and percent of population with a bachelors degree in 3,143 counties in the US in 2010. What are the explanatory and response variables? Describe the relationship between the two variables. Make sure to discuss unusual observations, if any. Can we conclude that having a bachelors degree increases ones income? Solutions The explanatory variable is percent of population with a bachelors degree and the response variable is per capita income (in thousands). There is a strong positive linear relationship between the two variables. As the percentage of population with a bachelors degree increases the per capita income increases as well. There are very few counties where more than 60% of the population have a bachelors degree and very few countries that have a more than $50,000 in per capita income. This is an observational study so we cannot make a causal statement based on the results. However, we can say that having a higher percentage of population with bachelors degree is associated with a higher per capita income. B. Ritz et al.

"],["STUDY.html", "Chapter 4 Studies 4.1 Objectives 4.2 Homework", " Chapter 4 Studies 4.1 Objectives Define and use properly in context all new terminology. Given a study description, be able to identify and explain the study using correct terms. Given a scenario, describe flaws in reasoning and propose study and sampling designs. 4.2 Homework 4.2.1 Problem 1 Propose a sampling strategy. A large college class has 160 students. All 160 students attend the lectures together, but the students are divided into 4 groups, each of 40 students, for lab sections administered by different teaching assistants. The professor wants to conduct a survey about how satisfied the students are with the course, and he believes that the lab section a student is in might affect the students overall satisfaction with the course. What type of study is this? Observational study. Suggest a sampling strategy for carrying out this study. Stratified sample, sample randomly within each section. 4.2.2 PRoblem 2 Flawed reasoning. Identify the flaw in reasoning in the following scenarios. Explain what the individuals in the study should have done differently if they wanted to make such strong conclusions. Students at an elementary school are given a questionnaire that they are required to return after their parents have completed it. One of the questions asked is, Do you find that your work schedule makes it difficult for you to spend time with your kids after school? Of the parents who replied, 85% said no. Based on these results, the school officials conclude that a great majority of the parents have no difficulty spending time with their kids after school. Solution Non-responders may have a different response to this question. The parents who returned the surveys are probably those who do not have difficulty spending time with their kids after school. Parents who work might not have returned the surveys since they probably have a busier schedule. A survey is conducted on a simple random sample of 1,000 women who recently gave birth, asking them about whether or not they smoked during pregnancy. A follow-up survey asking if the children have respiratory problems is conducted 3 years later, however, only 567 of these women are reached at the same address. The researcher reports that these 567 women are representative of all mothers. Solution It is unlikely that the women who were reached at the same address 3 years later are a random sample. These missing responders are probably renters (as opposed to homeowners) which means that they might be in a lower socio-economic status than the respondents. 4.2.3 Problem 3 Sampling strategies. A Math 377 student who is curious about the relationship between the amount of time students spend on social networking sites and their performance at school decides to conduct a survey. Four research strategies for collecting data are described below. In each, name the sampling method proposed and any bias you might expect. He randomly samples 40 students from the studys population, gives them the survey, asks them to fill it out and bring it back the next day. He gives out the survey only to his friends, and makes sure each one of them fills out the survey. He posts a link to an online survey on his Facebook wall and asks his friends to fill out the survey. He stands outside the QRC and asks every third person that walks out the door to fill out the survey. Solution a. Simple random sample. Non-response bias, if only those people who have strong opinions about the survey responds his sample may not be representative of the population. b. Convenience sample. Under coverage bias, his sample may not be representative of the population since it consists only of his friends. It is also possible that the study will have non-response bias if some choose to not bring back the survey. c. Convenience sample. This will have a similar issues to handing out surveys to friends. d. Convenience sample. Same. 4.2.4 Problem 4 Vitamin supplements. In order to assess the effectiveness of taking large doses of vitamin C in reducing the duration of the common cold, researchers recruited 400 healthy volunteers from staff and students at a university. A quarter of the patients were assigned a placebo, and the rest were evenly divided between 1g Vitamin C, 3g Vitamin C, or 3g Vitamin C plus additives to be taken at onset of a cold for the following two days. All tablets had identical appearance and packaging. The nurses who handed the prescribed pills to the patients knew which patient received which treatment, but the researchers assessing the patients when they were sick did not. No significant differences were observed in any measure of cold duration or severity between the four medication groups, and the placebo group had the shortest duration of symptoms. Was this an experiment or an observational study? Why? What are the explanatory and response variables in this study? Were the patients blinded to their treatment? Was this study double-blind? Participants are ultimately able to choose whether or not to use the pills prescribed to them. We might expect that not all of them will adhere and take their pills. Does this introduce a confounding variable to the study? Explain your reasoning. Solution a. Experiment, since the researchers randomly assigned different treatments to the participants. b. Response variable: Duration of the cold. Explanatory variable: Treatment, with 4 levels; placebo, 1g, 3g, 3g with additives. c. The patients were blinded as they did not know which treatment they received. d. The study was double-blind with respect to the researchers evaluating the patients, but the nurses who briely interacted with patients during the distribution of the medication were not blinded. (It was partially double-blind.) e. Since the patients were randomly assigned to the treatment groups and they are blinded we would expect about an equal number of patients in each group to not adhere to the treatment. While this means that final results of the study will be based on fewer number of participants, non-adherence does not introduce a confounding variable to the study. 4.2.5 Problem 5 Exercise and mental health. A researcher is interested in the effects of exercise on mental health and she proposes the following study: Use stratified random sampling to ensure representative proportions of 18-30, 31-40 and 41-55 year olds from the population. Next, randomly assign half the subjects from each age group to exercise twice a week, and instruct the rest not to exercise. Conduct a mental health exam at the beginning and at the end of the study, and compare the results. What type of study is this? What are the treatment and control groups in this study? Does this study make use of blocking? If so, what is the blocking variable? Does this study make use of blinding? Comment on whether or not the results of the study can be used to establish a causal relationship between exercise and mental health, and indicate whether or not the conclusions can be generalized to the population at large. Suppose you are given the task of determining if this proposed study should get funding. Would you have any reservations about the study proposal? Solution a. This is an experiment since we assigned subjects to the exercise program. b. The treatment is exercise twice a week and control is no exercise. c, Yes, the blocking variable is age. d. No, the study is not blinded since the patients will know whether or not they are exercising. e. Since this is an experiment, we can make a causal statement. Since the sample is random, the causal statement can be generalized to the population at large. However, we should be cautious about making a causal statement because of a possible placebo effect. f. It would be very difficult, if not impossible, to successfully conduct this study since randomly sampled people cannot be required to participate in a clinical trial.
